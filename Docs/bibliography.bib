% Here is a comment.

% Here is an example of how to create a bibliography entry for an article using
% BibTeX. Generally you won't have to write these out yourself, because they are
% provided by most web sites that allow you to export citations. The string
% "article-key" is a citation key, and if you were citing the source in a
% document you would use \cite{article-key}.
